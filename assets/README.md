#My First Web Page
Welcome!
This Project is intended to show my skill at using GetPod, Get and GetHub.
In this document I have added images and links to the wiki pages of the codes I am using, I have also created a few other pages to link to each other to test my skills with directory use.
Each page calls for the BootStrap information so if I feel it's needed I can call elements from there.
I have made a reference sheet holding the name of the images, the place they are used, what they are for and where they werre downloaded. This text file is the /website1/assets/img/ and is called img_list.txt
